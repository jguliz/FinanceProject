## DAX Measures

```
// Total Income
Total Income = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Transactions[Amount]),
    Categories[Category Group] = "Income"
)

// Total Expenses
Total Expenses = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Transactions[Amount]),
    Categories[Category Group] = "Expense"
)

// Net Cash Flow
Net Cash Flow = [Total Income] - [Total Expenses]

// Monthly Average Expense
Monthly Average Expense = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGEX(
        VALUES(Date[Month]),
        [Total Expenses]
    )
)

// Spending by Category
Spending by Category = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Transactions[Amount]),
    Categories[Category Group] = "Expense"
)

// Month-over-Month Growth
MoM Growth = 
VAR CurrentMonthCashFlow = 
    CALCULATE(
        [Net Cash Flow],
        FILTER(
            ALL(Date),
            Date[Month] = MAX(Date[Month])
        )
    )
VAR PreviousMonthCashFlow = 
    CALCULATE(
        [Net Cash Flow],
        FILTER(
            ALL(Date),
            Date[Month] = MAX(Date[Month]) - 1
        )
    )
RETURN
    DIVIDE(
        CurrentMonthCashFlow - PreviousMonthCashFlow,
        ABS(PreviousMonthCashFlow),
        0
    )
```

FORECAST(
    NEXTMONTH(MAX(Date[Date])),
    Transactions[Amount],
    Date[Date]
)
```

### What-If Parameters
